Documentation  for the Group Testing Shiny Package
========================================================

This is the documentation for the Group testing shiny package for 
sample size / confidence interval estimation.

* For using the pooled hypergeometric distribution, this is required 
by population sizes that are relatively small,  $ < N_max$, or for populations
that are specified. 
* For populations that are relatively large,  $ > N_max$, we use a binomial
approxiamtion.
